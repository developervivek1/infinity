When the Customer registers for the Service, ONEINFINITY requires a password from the Customer for the Customer’s privacy and security. OneInfinity uses industry-standard 128 bit secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect data transmissions between the Customer’s browser and ONEINFINITY’s servers, such as the Customer’s Registration Information for ONEINFINITY or Account Credentials. OneInfinity’s servers are in a secure third party facility. OneInfinity’s databases are protected from general employee access both physically and logically. ONEINFINITY stores a salted digest for the Customer’s Service password so that the Customer’s password cannot be recovered even by OneInfinity. All backup drives and tapes are encrypted. However, it is important to understand that these precautions apply only to ONEINFINITY’s Site and systems. While OneInfinity will have contractual agreements with third parties around data security, OneInfinity exercises no control over how the Customer’s information is stored, maintained or displayed by third parties or on third-party sites.</p>
